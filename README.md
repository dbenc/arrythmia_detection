# Detecting Arrythmia with Wavelet Transformation and Convolutional Neural Networks

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and new and exciting machine learning methods,
we can train computers to process large amount of data really quickly. Today we can automate
important procedures, such as, fault diagnosis in equipment, or in fact humans. We can use these tools
to monitor our health and in this project I studied Electrodiagrams (ECG), to monitor the proper
functioning of the cardiovascular system. With these methods professionals can save some time from
scattering endless ECG results and focus on things only humans can do.
